I split my code up into three notebooks:

1. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uZP4uJRHRIlue28hxYhHVPc2n_Pn-jZT
  (This contains my code for Problems 1 & 2)
  
2. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TyBiEiv0SDK7DvTO060rQiyO5dQ4PBfW
  (This contains my code for Problem 3.1 - Where I train the Xception model)

3. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1R03vg7M-gkxKVkMQAYk24kLpf-rUN5fi
  (This contains my code for Problem 3.2 - Where I attempt better accuracy)
